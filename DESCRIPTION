Package: LSTextras
Title: Small addition to LSTbook package: several data frames plus a small tweak to point_plot
Version: 0.1.6

Description: This package is meant to go with the book "Introduction to Business Statistics: A modeling Approach". 
It extends the LSTbook package slightly by adding several illustrative data frames and tweaks the point_plot function to 
handle the case when annot = "model" AND interval = "none". The version in LSTbook fails when interval = "none".
